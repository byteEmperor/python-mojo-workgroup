This is just a basic overview meant to serve as a starting point for a work group whose aim is to get better at coding in python.


# Resource Introduction

### 1. Setting-up the environment
In order to properly work with python we will need to set up the environment. The preffered way to do this is to run it locally, on our machines, and use a version controller - we shall follow up on this later on.

+ 1st option: Install an IDE from jetBrains:
    + get a license from [Educational License jetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students);
    + download and install [pyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
+ 2nd option: Install and run Jupyter locally:
    + follow the directions from the [official site](https://jupyter.org/install);
    + install [Anaconda](https://freelearning.anaconda.cloud/get-started-with-anaconda) in case you are using Windows.


### 2. Learning resources
The best learning resource that I have founds so far is the jetBrains hyperskill academy. The free plan is amazing for theory and decent for practice, whilst the premium plan is amazing for practice! The only downside for the premium plan is that it is very expensive. You can access it [here](https://hyperskill.org). 

In the "Explore all courses" python section you can find a myriad selection of tracks - some of which are quite useful to us (Introduction to Python, Coding Machine Learning Algorithms, Pandas for Data Analysis, Python Core, Python for Science, etc). I recommend that you start with "Introduction to Python" and "Python for Science". 

### 3. Mojo
What the heck is Mojo?
Mojo is a superset of python, which aims to combine the usability of higher level programming languages (like python) with the performance of lower level programming languages, like c++. 

Links for Mojo:
+ In order to install it you'll have to follow the steps detailed in [this page](https://docs.modular.com/max/install), keep in mind what OS you have. It will be a bit harder to set it up on Windows.
+ The introduction to this programming language can be found [here](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/basics).
+ In case you want to use it in pyCharm, you can find a plugin called "Mojo".
